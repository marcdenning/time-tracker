      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>As a consultant, I have to track the time I am working on client projects.
        As a practice manager, other non-billable responsibilities also take time, and I would like to better track the
        effort I am applying to those activities.
        For instance, how much time do I spend working on proposals? Or internal initiatives?</p>

      <p>At the time of writing, I've been away from React and other front-end web technologies for a bit, so I decided
        to roll my own time tracking app.
        I know there are plenty of free and commercial solutions out there, but I enjoy the process of building and
        creating.</p>

      <p>I plan to publish updates to the app over time as I expand on its features.
        I expect to only build features that I am going to use and aim to keep this simple.
        That said, if you have ideas or want to use this for yourself, feel free to submit a GitHub issue or pull request.</p>
